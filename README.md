# Proyecto-web-Carrito
This project simulates an interactive shopping cart for an online course platform. Users can view a variety of courses, add them to their cart, and empty it whenever they wish. JavaScript is used to handle user interaction, such as adding items to the cart, updating quantities, and displaying selected products in real time.
